# PROJECT 1
## Retail Store Sales Performance Analysis
### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the sales performance of a retail store using a combination of Excel, SQL, and Power BI to uncover key insights into product performance, regional sales trends, and customer purchasing behaviors. By leveraging data analysis techniques and visualization tools, I was able to transform raw sales data into actionable insights for the retail business. This analysis is therefore a comprehensive exploration of sales data aimed at optimizing product offerings, improving regional strategies, and enhancing customer engagement.
____________
### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to perform a thorough analysis of the retail store's sales data and:
- Identify top-selling products in optimizing inventory management.
- Analyze sales performance by region to refine marketing strategies.
- Understand monthly sales patterns to drive better forecasting.
- Uncover key trends in customer behavior to boost sales and profitability.
- Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize these insights for stakeholders, enabling data-driven decision-making.

### Data Source
The dataset for this analysis was provided by **The Incubator Hub** as part of a data analysis training program. The sales data encompassed a wide range of information related to retail transactions, allowing for an in-depth analysis of sales performance and customer behavior.

#### Data Characteristics
The dataset contained the following key columns:
- OrderId: This is a unique identifier for each transaction.
- CustomerID: This is a unique identifier for each customer, enabling customer-level analysis.
- Products: These are the names of the products sold.
- Regions: These are the geographical regions where sales were made, helping identify regional performance.
- Order Date: This is the date when the order was placed, allowing for time-series analysis.
- Quantities: These are the quantity of products purchased in each transaction.
- Unit Price: This is the selling price of each product unit.
- Revenue: This is the total revenue generated for each transaction (calculated as `Quantities * Unit Price`).
  
These characteristics therefore enabled me to conduct a detailed analysis of sales trends, customer behaviors, and regional performance on the dataset.

### Tools Used
1. Microsoft Excel

Excel was used for the initial data cleaning, exploration, and preliminary analysis. The following steps were performed:
* Data Cleaning: Removed duplicates and handled missing values to ensure data integrity.
* Basic Calculations: Used formulas such as `SUMIF` and `AVERAGEIFS` to calculate key metrics like total revenue by region and average sales by product
  
`=SUMIF($D$2:$D$9922,"north",$H$2:$H$9922)`
`=SUMIF($D$2:$D$9922,"EAST",$H$2:$H$9922)`
`=AVERAGEIF($C$2:$C$9922,"HAT",$H$2:$H$9922)`
`=AVERAGEIF($C$2:$C$9922,"JACKET",$H$2:$H$9922)`

![SalesData metrics](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8239a43-c730-4ff9-a29e-0919ed4b29d0)

* Pivot Tables: Created pivot tables to generate reports on:
  - Total sales by Product.
  - Sales distribution by Region.
  - Monthly sales trends and some other reports.
    
![Sales Pivot A](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7084fe0e-8552-4506-a727-770303cae1f6)

 ![Sales Pivot B](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/09e74388-d332-4b77-8bb0-582d467cd6f7)

These analyses generated show a summarized report to identify the highest-performing product, regional sales trends, monthly performance, and some other relevant insight into the retail store.


2. SQL

SQL was used to perform deeper data analysis by running structured queries to extract key insights. The following SQL queries were written:

i. Total Sales for Each Product Category: This calculated the total revenue generated by each product category.
```
SELECT * FROM CapstoneSalesdata;

select Product, sum(revenue) as Total_sales
from CapstoneSalesdata
Group by product
```
ii. Number of Sales Transactions per Region: This extracted the count of transactions to identify which regions had the highest sales activity.
```
select Region,count(revenue) as Number_of_sales
from CapstoneSalesdata
Group by Region
```
iii. Highest-Selling Product by Total Sales Value: This query identified the product that generated the highest revenue, which turned out to be **Shoes @ 613,380**
```
select Top 1 Product, sum(revenue) as Total_sales
from CapstoneSalesdata
Group by product 
Order by Total_sales desc
```
vi. Monthly Sales Totals for the Current Year: This analyzed the monthly sales to observe seasonal trends.
```
Select month(orderdate)as Months, sum(revenue) as Total_sales 
from CapstoneSalesdata
where year(orderdate) = 2024
Group by month(orderdate)
Order by Months 
```
vi. Top 5 Customers by Total Purchase Amount: This identified the top customers based on their total spending.
```SELECT TOP 5 Customer_Id,
SUM(revenue) AS TotalPurchaseAmount
FROM CapstoneSalesdata
GROUP BY Customer_Id
ORDER BY TotalPurchaseAmount DESC;
```
v. Percentage of Total Sales Contributed by Each Region: Determined the sales contribution of each region relative to the overall total.
```
    SELECT Region, SUM(revenue) AS TotalSales,
	SUM(revenue) * 1.0/ (select SUM(revenue)
    FROM CapstoneSalesdata) * 100
	as PercentageofTotalsales
	from CapstoneSalesdata
```
vi. Products with No Sales in the Last Quarter: This query flagged products that had no sales in the past three months, indicating potential inventory issues.
```
	SELECT distinct product, orderid, quantity FROM CapstoneSalesdata
	where product NOT IN (Select distinct product from CapstoneSalesdata
	where OrderDate between '2024-07-01' and '2024-09-30'
	)
```

3. Power BI

Power BI was utilized to create an interactive dashboard that visualizes the insights found in Excel and SQL analyses. The dashboard includes:

- Sales Overview: A high-level summary of total sales, top-performing products, and key metrics.
- Top-Performing Products: Visualizations showing which products and categories drive the most revenue.
- Regional Breakdowns: Maps and charts illustrating sales performance by region.
- Monthly Trends: Line charts showing how sales fluctuate throughout the year.
Interactive Filters: Slicers for dynamic exploration of data by product category, region, and time period.

SELECT Region, COUNT(CustomerID) AS CustomerCount
FROM Customers
GROUP BY Region;
Most Popular Subscription Type by Customer Count:
```

```sql
SELECT SubscriptionType, COUNT(CustomerID) AS CustomerCount
FROM Subscriptions
GROUP BY SubscriptionType
ORDER BY CustomerCount DESC;
Subscription Cancellations within 6 Months:
```
